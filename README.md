# Project Title
CityExplorer / WanderMap 

## Overview
Full Stack City Guide Application
CityExplorer would be an interactive platform allowing users to discover and explore cities through local recommendations, personalized itineraries, and authentic experiences.

### Problem Space
Information Overload
Travelers are overwhelmed by generic tourist information and countless reviews across multiple platforms. They struggle to filter through endless options to find authentic experiences that match their interests.

Inefficient Planning Process
Creating itineraries is time-consuming, involving multiple websites, spreadsheets, and manual mapping to organize a cohesive travel plan.

Unreliable Information
Operating hours, pricing, and availability information is often outdated on existing platforms, leading to frustrating travel experiences.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Add any special considerations that your app must take into account.

Travelers & Tourists
Remote Workers & Digital Nomads
Curious Explorers & Students

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

- As a user, I want to be able to browse through cities from around the world and find out more about them.
- As a user, I want to be able to explore specific attractions within each city, whether theyâ€™re tourist landmarks, hidden gems, restaurants, museums, parks, etc.
